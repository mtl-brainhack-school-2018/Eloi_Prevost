## I need help with :
# Compute Canada
This is the most urgent. Learning how to use compute canda would allow me to optimize my time during braihack and allow me to absorb more knowledge from brainhack school.
  * Deadline : Today (May 23) or tomorrow (May 24)

# Analysing results
I would like to learn the basics (or more if time allows me) of nilearn and sklearn in order to be able to analyse preprocessed data.
  * Deadline : begin Friday (May 25) if possible

## I can help with :
  * A little bit with Niak preprocessing
  * A little bit with python/jupyter notebook
